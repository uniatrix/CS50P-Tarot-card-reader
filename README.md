**Tarot Reading Program**

This Python program allows users to perform tarot card readings by drawing a specified number of cards and receiving a detailed reading based on their question. The program integrates with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model to generate personalized tarot readings.

**Features:**

1. **Tarot Card Classes**: The program defines two classes, `TarotCard` and `TarotDeck`, to represent individual tarot cards and the entire deck, respectively. Each `TarotCard` object contains attributes such as name, meaning, category (Major Arcana or Minor Arcana), suit (if applicable), and number (if applicable).

2. **Card Data**: The program includes dictionaries containing data for both major and minor arcana cards, including their meanings, suits, and numbers (for minor arcana). This data is used to populate the `TarotDeck` object with individual `TarotCard` instances.

3. **User Interaction**: Users can interact with the program by asking a question and specifying the number of tarot cards they want to draw for their reading. The program validates user input to ensure the number of cards falls within a valid range (1 to 20).

4. **Tarot Reading**: The program randomly draws the specified number of cards from the deck and displays their details, including name, meaning, suit (for minor arcana), and number (for minor arcana). It then constructs a prompt containing the user's question, the drawn cards, and a system message to feed into the GPT-3.5 model for generating the tarot reading.

5. **GPT Integration**: The program integrates with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model to generate a detailed tarot reading based on the user's question and the drawn cards. It sends a prompt containing relevant information to the GPT-3.5 model and receives the generated response. Users need to provide their OpenAI API key to use this feature.

6. **Output**: Finally, the program displays the user's question, the drawn cards, and the generated tarot reading.

**How to Use:**

1. Run the Python script `tarot_reading.py`.
2. Input your question when prompted.
3. Specify the number of tarot cards you want to draw.
4. View the drawn cards and their meanings.
5. Wait for the program to generate your personalized tarot reading.
6. Read and interpret the generated tarot reading.

**Dependencies:**

- Python 3.x
- OpenAI Python SDK (Install via `pip install openai`)

**Note:** Before using the GPT Integration feature, users must provide their OpenAI API key in the `gpt_integration()` function within the Python script. Replace `"PROVIDE HERE YOUR API KEY"` with your actual API key. Please ensure you have an OpenAI API key to use this feature.
